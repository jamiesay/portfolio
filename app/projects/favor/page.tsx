            <p>While Favor was a successfully developed concept, we faced the challenge of creating the most effective user interface for our customers. The goal of the platform is to create an online space for the exchange of goods and services between college students in the same geographical area. In the product design, I needed to create an interface that was easy to navigate for college students, supported browsing of goods and services, and the point of exchange itself.

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Enhanced Onboarding Process:</strong> Introduced an onboarding flow designed to familiarize new users with Favor&apos;s core features quickly and intuitively, emphasizing the ease of listing requests and offers. This included a simplified, visually engaging step-by-step guide for new users to list their first favor or browse existing offers.<br/ >
              <strong>Interactive Tutorial on Posting and Searching for Favors:</strong> Added interactive tooltips and prompts to help users explore how to post, search, and respond to favors, highlighting popular and community-centric exchanges like tutoring and study material sharing.<br />
              <strong>In-App Gamification to Boost Engagement:</strong> Designed a reward system that incentivizes users to complete various actions, such as listing or completing their first favor, to build early engagement and establish a habit of activity on the platform.<br />
              <strong>Improved UI for Service Discovery:</strong> Optimized the interface to make browsing and searching for services more intuitive, ensuring that users could quickly connect with peers needing similar services.<br />
              <strong>Backend Enhancements for Real-Time Updates:</strong> Built and integrated real-time notifications for responses to posted favors, helping users stay engaged and respond promptly, enhancing user interaction and satisfaction.</p>

            <p>The introduction of these solutions yielded significant improvements in engagement metrics:<br/ >
            <br />
            <strong>32% Increase in Active Engagement:</strong> The percentage of active users increased by 32% post-launch, with more users posting and completing favors.<br/ >
